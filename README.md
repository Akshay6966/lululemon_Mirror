# Lululemon MIRROR – Integrated Marketing Plan Report


## Project Background

The **Lululemon MIRROR** project focuses on designing and executing an integrated marketing plan to introduce MIRROR — an interactive, at-home fitness platform — to target consumers. The analysis and plan aim to build awareness, drive demand and sales, foster community, and position Lululemon as a thought leader in the at-home fitness space.

## Executive Summary

### Overview Of Findings

Lululemon’s brand strength and MIRROR’s unique, tech-forward proposition create a strong opportunity to capture the growing at-home fitness market.
